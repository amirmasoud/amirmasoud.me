Solution:

<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">chcp 1252</pre>

    This is caused by your current terminal as it is using a codepage (encoding) that is not supported by Ruby. Codepage 720 is Arabic characters used by MS-DOS back in the day and seems Ruby do not have a translation table for it.
