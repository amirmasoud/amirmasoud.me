The book is a very fragmented, a shortened version of papers. I have to say the book seems very like a how to be a perfect flattering person in your career. If you really believe you want to spend the rest of your life in a hierarchical organization. You just want to get promotion and earn money, this book can be your hidden gem but comes at the cost of literally giving up yourself to satisfy your boss(es) and colleague; this is far away from having an ego.

But if you are working in a flatten structure company, I have to say you would look like an ass-kisser person in your colleague&#8217;s eyes if you put this book best practices to action, But you can read and avoid and be a reasonable person.

The irony part of the book for me was that it constantly reminded me of my cat, that&#8217;s how my cat reacts to my family and me according to how often each of us feeds her and gives corresponding feedbacks (she rarely purrs for me!). I felt on multiple parts of the book are merely training the reader to be ”such a good dog” to their boss(es) and colleague.
