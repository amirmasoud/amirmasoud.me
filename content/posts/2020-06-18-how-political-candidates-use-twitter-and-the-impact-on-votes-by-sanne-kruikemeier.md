## **Goal** {.wp-block-heading}

The paper aims to find out how much using a social platform; in this case, Twitter would affect a politician preferential votes. Their presence on Twitter includes interacting with their potential voters and sharing their private persona. Further, it investigates the effect of candidates&#8217; personalized communication on the number of preferential votes they receive.

## **Data** {.wp-block-heading}

They have collected all political tweets by candidates in the period leading up to the Dutch national elections on June 9, 2010, and 2 months after. Aggregated data contained 40,957 tweets, posted by 177 politicians from 8 political parties. They have analyzed the collected dataset using both computer-assisted and manual analysis.

## **Results** {.wp-block-heading}

- The number of tweets posted by political candidates increased during the election campaign and decreased after the Election Day.
- Interactivity and personalization are indeed key characteristics of online political communication.
- The significant effect of Twitter use by candidates will cause the number of votes they received.
- The more reciprocal interaction a political candidate uses in their communication on Twitter, the more preferential votes this political candidate will receive.
- No significant relationship between the amounts of retweets or hashtags used by the candidate and the number of preferential votes
- Being more popular on Twitter has positive effects on electoral support, although sending out more tweets does not lead to significantly more preferential votes.
- Using a more personalized style of online campaigning on Twitter had no impact on electoral support.
- using Twitter during the election campaign resulted in more votes, than not using Twitter

## **My Personal Takeaway and possible future expansions** {.wp-block-heading}

- Twitter effects politicians&#8217; electoral success, and they should interact with their voters to be popular.
- Twitter is an excellent source of a dataset. Especially on narrowed audiences such as politicians, musicians, or other famous people.
- Expanding the dataset timeframe from 3 months to the whole in-the-office period can induce more in-depth conclusions about politician online behavior.
- If this process becomes automated with a little flavor of machine learning and artificial intelligence, we could scrutinize politicians&#8217; thoughts and actions more than ever.
- It can be a glimpse or hint at the future of governments that people tend to interact directly with the decisions politicians are making.
