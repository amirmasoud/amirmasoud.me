You might have heard about him from _The Daily Show_. I think he&#8217;s doing stand-up comedy now (please don&#8217;t fact-check me).

It&#8217;s a picture book that tells a story about a boy who goes on an adventureâ€”one might say a rebellionâ€”to explore and understand.

It&#8217;s well-written and well-illustrated. I read it on the day of my birthday at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/fXRtaMqproYoyXaK7" data-type="link" data-id="https://maps.app.goo.gl/fXRtaMqproYoyXaK7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weller Book Works</a> in Salt Lake City. I didn&#8217;t buy it because I think I can probably buy a used version later for a cheaper price just to have it.

While I was reading, I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about the similarities between this book and _<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157993.The_Little_Prince" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157993.The_Little_Prince" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Little Prince</a>_ by Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry. I think _Into the Uncut Grass_ had some inspiration from it and made it a better book for readers like me.

I did like this book and I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
