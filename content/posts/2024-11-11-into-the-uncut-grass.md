A [book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/123133352-into-the-uncut-grass) written by Christopher Myers and Trevor Noah. You might have heard about him from _The Daily Show_. I think he's doing stand-up comedy now (please don't fact-check me).

It's a picture book that tells a story about a boy who goes on an adventure—one might say a rebellion—to explore and understand.

It's well-written and well-illustrated. I read it on the day of my birthday at [Weller Book Works](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fXRtaMqproYoyXaK7) in Salt Lake City. I didn't buy it because I think I can probably buy a used version later for a cheaper price just to have it.

While I was reading, I couldn't stop thinking about the similarities between this book and _[The Little Prince](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/157993.The_Little_Prince)_ by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. I think _Into the Uncut Grass_ had some inspiration from it and made it a better book for readers like me.

I did like this book and I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
