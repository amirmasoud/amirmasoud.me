I went there on Saturday night, November 16th, 2024, around 8:30 PM. I already had a table reserved for myself. I was warmly welcomed, didn’t need to wait, and was seated immediately.

I had checked their menu online beforehand and knew what I wanted to order, but I still reviewed their menu at the restaurant since prices weren’t listed online. Here’s their menu from their website:

I was in the mood for seafood since I usually can’t have it during workdays, and I wanted to try their seafood offerings. For my main dish, I ordered the Miso Cod along with one Beef Yakitori. On the side, I chose Truffle Mashed Potatoes.

For my drink, I went with their _Sage Daze_ cocktail, which turned out to be an excellent choice. It had a great taste with a slight bitterness—exactly what I was looking for. The drink arrived before my main course and sides. Take a look:

Shortly after my drink, I was served the Beef Yakitori. I have to say, the sauce was amazing—I didn’t want to miss a drop of it. The meat was almost well-done, delicious, and slightly spicy, giving it a very desirable flavor:

A few minutes later, my main dish, the Miso Cod, arrived. It was one of the softest seafood dishes I’ve ever had—so tender and delicate that I didn’t want to waste a single bite.

If I’m not mistaken, there was spinach at the bottom, which paired wonderfully with the cod:

I finished my meal with the Truffle Mashed Potatoes and another _Sage Daze_ cocktail, making my Saturday night dinner absolutely amazing.

The servers were all very polite and professional, and they even helped me connect to their guest Wi-Fi network. I stayed for about an hour or less. They had live music/a DJ, and the atmosphere of the place was fantastic.

I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice meal, whether dining alone or with friends or family.

My bill came to about $108. I am not affiliated with them. Go check it out and try it for yourself!
