The gym was almost empty today (Nov 30th, 2024), it felt like heaven. I even warmed up on the chest press machine. I took proper rest between sets and completed six exercises. Overall, it was a good workout today. The gym had been closed for two days for the Thanksgiving holiday.

Afterward, I went for some cardio and ran/walked a little over 5K on the treadmill in over 60 minutes. While running, I watched Season 6, Episode 2 (the &#8220;black shirt&#8221; episode) of _Peaky Blinders_. The only reason I resubscribed to Netflix for $6.99 a month was to catch up on this show. Even so, I still have to endure ads with their basic plan. I take out my AirPods during ad breaks. And no, I’m not upgrading to their “better” plan lol.

I’ve bought all the previous episodes for $2 each. Honestly, paying for a single episode and enjoying it fully felt like a much better experience.
