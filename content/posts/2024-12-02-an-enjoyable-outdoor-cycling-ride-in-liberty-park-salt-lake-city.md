Here’s a video of me cycling in Liberty Park, Salt Lake City, on Friday, November 29th, 2024.

I used a GoPro 10 mounted on my bicycle handlebar. For this recording, I turned off both the stabilizer and GPS. I used two batteries to record just under two hours of video.

I ride a Trek Marlin 5 Gen 2, which I’ve had for almost two years. I really like it, it just works!

The weather was cold when I first went out around 8 AM, so I had to return home, put on warmer clothes, and then head back.

**Total distance:** ~14 miles  
**Total duration:** 1 hour and 15 minutes
