I had a table reservation at 8 PM on Saturday at Arlo in Salt Lake City. It’s very close to the Utah State Capitol (<a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/6cpLUrNttR5NrEaY9" data-type="link" data-id="https://maps.app.goo.gl/6cpLUrNttR5NrEaY9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Maps</a>), and it’s a bit hidden, though still quite busy.

They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but it was too cold for me to sit outside. The indoor environment is beautiful and cozy, and the view of the quiet street on a Saturday was actually quite nice.

Unfortunately, I forgot to take a picture of their food menu, but here is their drink menu:<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

To be honest, as a non-native English speaker, I really enjoyed their food and drink menu. They didn’t use fancy or made-up words for their dishes. Want fish? The menu says &#8216;FISH!&#8217; Want a Tequila cocktail? That’s exactly what it’s called: a &#8216;Tequila Cocktail!&#8217; And that’s exactly what I ordered, Fish and Tequila Cocktail.

I also ordered &#8216;Some Soup,&#8217; and it was delicious. My drink came first, though, and it was strong, no hesitation in adding Tequila there at all!<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

Just a few short minutes after I finished my soup, my fish arrived. It was beautifully wrapped and came with a delicious, good-looking vegetable side. The fish was incredibly soft, and I didn’t need to struggle to separate the meat from the skin. It was really something special.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">

I had a cup of coffee after finishing my dinner. I was there for less than an hour, but I really enjoyed my time, food, and drink. The server at my table was fantastic, she even adjusted my total because I ordered my coffee after she had already brought me the check. (My bad!)

My total came to $66.34, which I think was totally worth it considering the quality of the fish, the good soup, great drink, and coffee. I highly recommend it if you&#8217;re looking to enjoy some delicious food in a cozy, beautiful place in Salt Lake City.
