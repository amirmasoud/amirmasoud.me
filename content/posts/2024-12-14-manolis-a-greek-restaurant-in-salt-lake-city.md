I went there on Saturday night, December 14th, 2024, around 8:30 PM. I already had a table reserved for myself. I was able to sit at the table that I thought I would like to sit at.

I had a rough idea of what I wanted to order from browsing their online menu, but it turned out they had more cocktails than what was listed online. Here's their menu:

I ordered Apostalagma Ouzo spirit, Paidakia (grilled lamb riblets), and Patates (crispy fingerling potatoes). At the end of my meal, I also ordered a cup of coffee. The waiting time for my food and drink was a bit longer than I expected, but when my server brought my drink, she also brought my main and side dishes.

Overall, the environment was nice and enjoyable. Finding a parking spot wasn't hard, and the servers were polite and professional. Manoli's is definitely a very decent place to dine and enjoy a good meal and drink.

My bill came to about $50.68. I am not affiliated with them.
