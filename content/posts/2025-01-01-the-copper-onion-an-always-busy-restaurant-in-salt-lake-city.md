I went there on Wednesday noon, January 1st, 2025, around 1:30 PM. I already had a table reserved for myself and was able to sit at a corner table.

I was there for brunch and ordered a cup of espresso to start:

For the main course, I ordered Steak & Eggs. I asked for the steak to be well done and the eggs to be scrambled.

Whenever I go to a restaurant, I also ask for their guest WiFi password, as my mobile data is limited. I always use a secure VPN when I'm on public WiFi. Their WiFi speed is good for a public network:

After I finished my meal, I ordered a fruit bowl:

I had a couple of problems here, though: my table was sticky even after a second wipe, and the waiting time was too long in my opinion. However, there was nothing wrong with the food. It's definitely worth trying at least once if you're looking for a good place to eat.

My bill came to about $41. I am not affiliated with them.
