Today, I’m going to Sarah Silverman’s Postmortem tour at around 8 PM. But before that, I have a pizza to eat! I went to The Pie Pizzeria (Underground) at around 5 PM. I ordered a 14" Pie's Combo with a glass of beer.

Their pizza is everything I could ever ask for in a pizza, to be honest. I really enjoy their pizza, and the wait time is really short. You also don’t need to make any reservations.

Inside the restaurant, there’s a lot of wall art. One of them is a picture of [Marilyn Monroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe):

I managed to eat almost half of my pizza and took the other half in a to-go box. After that, I headed to Sarah Silverman’s Postmortem show.

I want to keep this short, but there were some really annoying things about her show. One was that they wouldn’t let you use your phone—they put your phone/watch in a pouch bag (which you obviously cannot open). There wasn’t a single clock in the entire place (Kingsbury Hall). Also, no outside water was allowed, so I had to buy water—each bottle costing $5, with a long line to wait in. The show itself was fine, maybe a 6 out of 10.

I also learned tonight that when I see someone I probably know, I can just ignore them and pretend I didn’t see them. It’s mostly inconvenient for them, I guess, to encounter someone they might know, so I can just leave them alone without bothering them.

My bill came to about $30. I am not affiliated with them.
