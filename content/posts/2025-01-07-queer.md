*Queer Poster*

I watched this movie tonight at 9:30PM at [Broadway Centre Cinemas](https://maps.app.goo.gl/2NER7PANR3nRxJms8) located at 111 E Broadway, 300 S, Salt Lake City, UT 84111.

I generally enjoyed the movie; it has a good story and is exciting to follow. The only part where I felt a bit disconnected was during the transition scenes and dream sequences. I would rate it a 6.5 out of 10, maybe a 7.
