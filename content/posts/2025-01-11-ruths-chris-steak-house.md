summary: This Saturday I went to Ruth's Chris steak house in Salt Lake City, Fancy!

---

It is located at [275 S W Temple St, Salt Lake City, UT 84101](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dywMSG5Tc9dTY2FF7), kind of hidden if you ask me, but everyone drives there, so whatever I guess. I walked there though because I live relatively close to them. There was a cool art at enterance:

I was quickly seated, and I quickly realized that I'm the weird one dinning by myself, I guess its too fancy there to dine by yourself. I was also seated right next to the tray area where servers return (throw) trays there :), it was fucking loud.

I ordered bone-in new york strip: medium rare, and lobster mac & cheese. For the steak I was first thinking about well-done, but the server suggested medium rare as it is being served in 500 degree dish. It was a good call and I did like it medium rare!

For the drink, I was thinking about Malbec, in Utah they require ID to serve alchohol, so I gave them my driver license which was expired yesterday (yes expired less than 24 hours ago) and they couldn't order Malbec, magical night.

My meal took less than 30 minutes to be served and it looked delicious and it was sooo good:

Lobster mac & cheese was so freaking cute and tempting. I managed to eat the entire lobster mac & cheese and half of the steak. the medium rare steak reminded me of the persian kebabs. What I ordered could be for 3 people to be honest.

The good part of dinning alone is that when I had my steak and mac & cheese I was so focused on my food that I literally didn't notice anyone else around me. It was just me and the food without any shitty conversation.

While I was waiting for my food I was reading an article about KTM 890 SMT, hell of bike it seems but there were some people saying KTM is not a reliable brand. (I guess in compare to brand like Honda). The WiFi speed there was OK, could be better but for reading a couple of news and checking Reddit was good enough:

I was using Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 WARP when I connected to their public WiFi.

My bill came to about $100 (without tip).
