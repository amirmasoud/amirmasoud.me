*Kawasaki Ninja 400*

I had this bike for almost a year and rode it for about 1000 miles, not long, but I loved it.

I learned how to ride on it and also learned how to do some basic maintenance on it. Originally I bought it for $5000, and I was lucky enough to find someone to sell it to for the same price, which kind of make it like that I rented the bike.

I'm looking for a new bike to go on some solo trips around Utah, can't wait :)
