*Highlight of the night*

I want to a wine tasting class tonight, and it was my first time going to a wine tasting class.
Predictability, I was the only solo person there lol, like always. Anyway, I learned a little bit about
different wines and how they categorized them. They had four different type of wines for tasting, two
white wines and two red wines. I also learned that apples and cheese can make the taste of the wine
different. Honestly most of the concept of different tastes of wine is still a bit remote to me, but I
am trying to educate myself. Beside the good wines, there was this resident cat there and she was gorgeous!
