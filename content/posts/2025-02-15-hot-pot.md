*Hotpot*

I ordered different plates and cooked them in my hotpot, it was fun. I tried to taste different plates
they were offering which was fine. I think it was just not the best idea to go there by myself without
doing a little bit of more research on what to order and how to cook each plates, I even didn't know
how to use chopsticks and asked for a fork and spoon and they just had fork lol.
