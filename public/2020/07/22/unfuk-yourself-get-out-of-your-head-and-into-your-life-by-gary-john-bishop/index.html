    <title>Unfu*k Yourself: Get Out of Your Head and Into Your Life by Gary John Bishop | Amirmasoud</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1">
    <meta name="description" content="The book covers a portion of problems, solutions, mistakes, and some solutions to personal life happenings. It is more on the side of motivational speech rather than giving you a roadmap. Of course, if you are looking for a well-thought solution, this book might not suit your will. It is more of a written YouTube motivational video that showcases quotes from well-known people and tries to hype you up.
It gives solutions like you should give up your bad habits, build good habits instead of it, or you need to change your subconscious without any further details on how one should accomplish such goals. Until the last chapter of the book, where the author introduces his website and claims you need a coach to develop such traits in yourself, which leaves you wondering that you were reading a marketing book all along for his website and advertising his personal development programs.">

<p>Will this book give you an internal boost to do what you want to do for a couple of hours or even weeks? Sure, will this hype stay with you for the long term? No, especially those who have read and heard these kinds of motivational speeches, they wouldnâ€™t feel any difference before and after reading this book.</p>
<p>2 stars out of 5 are my rating to this book.</p>
