    <title>Into the Uncut Grass by Trevor Noah | Amirmasoud</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,minimum-scale=1">
    <meta name="description" content="A book written by Christopher Myers and Trevor Noah. You might have heard about him from The Daily Show. I think heâ€™s doing stand-up comedy now (please donâ€™t fact-check me).
Itâ€™s a picture book that tells a story about a boy who goes on an adventureâ€”one might say a rebellionâ€”to explore and understand.
Itâ€™s well-written and well-illustrated. I read it on the day of my birthday at Weller Book Works in Salt Lake City. I didnâ€™t buy it because I think I can probably buy a used version later for a cheaper price just to have it.">

<p>While I was reading, I couldnâ€™t stop thinking about the similarities between this book and <em><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Little Prince<!-- raw HTML omitted --></em> by Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry. I think <em>Into the Uncut Grass</em> had some inspiration from it and made it a better book for readers like me.</p>
<p>I did like this book and I give it 4 out of 5 stars.</p>
