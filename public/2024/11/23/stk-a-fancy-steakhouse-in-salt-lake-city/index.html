I had a table reservation for 8:30 PM. They offered me the choice of a dining table or a seat at the bar. I chose a dining table in the corner.</p>
<p>At that time, the restaurant was fully packed with people dining. There was live music, and the lighting was dim. The server at my table brought me water and handed me the menu. They have a variety of foods and drinks to choose from, and, let’s be honest, they were pricey. Take a look at the menu:</p>

<p>For my drink, I ordered the Award Winning Spicy Watermelon, a tequila cocktail that tasted great. The spice was only on half the rim of the glass, making it easy to avoid—which I did—if you’re not a fan of spicy flavors.</p>

<p>For my main course, I ordered the 10oz medium filet steak but requested it well done, as I was primarily there to taste their steak. Before the main dish arrived, they brought me complimentary bread, which was surprisingly delicious and served as an amazing appetizer.</p>

<p>Finally, the main course arrived: my 10oz filet steak with chimichurri on the side. It was cooked to a perfectly well done, served hot, and well cut. The meat was tender, tasty, and totally free of any waste.</p>
<p><a href="/2024/12/IMG_0200.jpeg"><img src="/2024/12/IMG_0200.jpeg" alt="Main dish"></a>
<a href="/2024/12/IMG_0204.jpeg"><img src="/2024/12/IMG_0204.jpeg" alt="steak"></a></p>
<p>Overall, the food was amazing, the drink was special, and the complimentary bread was a pleasant surprise. The restaurant had a vibrant atmosphere and wonderful servers. The only downside was the cost. While the food was great, it could have been more affordable. My total came to $104.</p>
<p>They are a chain restaurant, and I visited their Salt Lake City location. While experiences may vary, I highly encourage anyone looking to celebrate a birthday or anniversary to book a table there. It’s a great place to enjoy delicious food and create lasting memories.</p>
