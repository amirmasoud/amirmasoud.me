<p>I went to Costco and chose the smallest turkey they had, which was just over 10 pounds (sorry, little fella). They had turkeys over 20 pounds, but I went with the smaller size because it is just me (lol). The turkey was priced at $0.99 per pound. It was snowing in Salt Lake City when I went on Tuesday, November 26th. I grabbed my turkey, along with a couple of random seasonings, although I ended up not using them.</p>
<p>I watched a lot of YouTube videos to learn how to cook it and, based on what others said, I decided to brine the turkey. It seemed like a legit way to get a flavorful, tasty bird. The problem was that I didn’t have any kosher salt. I started cooking on Thursday, November 28th, Thanksgiving Day, and since Smith’s was the only store open, I went there to buy kosher salt, along with some herbs and vegetables.</p>
<p>I thoroughly washed my turkey, dried it off, and made sure there was nothing left in its cavity. I placed it on the cutting board and began preparing my brine.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>After preparing the brine and getting everything ready, I realized a few things:</p>

<p>Sooooo… I decided to carve it—guess where I learned how? YouTube, of course! I cut the turkey in half and carved it. I ended up with two thighs, two breasts, and two legs. I bagged half of it and put it in the freezer, then dropped the rest into my brine.</p>
<p>I waited approximately 7-8 hours, then placed the three parts of the turkey into an oven-safe container. I added some of my favorite herbs, along with a little butter and oil, and threw in some onion and potatoes as well.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>The sweet spot for me was that I only needed to wait 60 minutes for it to cook. I waited for 60 minutes, called my parents in between, and after the 60 minutes of cook time, I gave it another 10 minutes. And here is the final result:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I had a little leftover rice and made myself a cocktail (sort of) with red wine, sparkling water, and lemon. The entire dinner, to be honest, wasn’t that bad. I had a pleasant meal with a delicious (half) turkey, and most of the turkey ended up as leftovers anyway. Cooking just half the turkey turned out to be a pretty good idea.</p>
<p>I learned a few things, though:</p>
