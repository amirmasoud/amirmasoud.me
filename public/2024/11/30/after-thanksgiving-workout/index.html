    <meta name="description" content="The gym was almost empty today (Nov 30th, 2024), it felt like heaven. I even warmed up on the chest press machine.

Afterward, I went for some cardio and ran/walked a little over 5K on the treadmill in over 60 minutes. While running, I watched Season 6, Episode 2 (the “black shirt” episode) of Peaky Blinders.

<p>Afterward, I went for some cardio and ran/walked a little over 5K on the treadmill in over 60 minutes. While running, I watched Season 6, Episode 2 (the “black shirt” episode) of <em>Peaky Blinders</em>. The only reason I resubscribed to Netflix for $6.99 a month was to catch up on this show.

<p>I’ve bought all the previous episodes for $2 each. Honestly, paying for a single episode and enjoying it fully felt like a much better experience.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
