      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a video of me cycling in Liberty Park, Salt Lake City, on Friday, November 29th, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used a GoPro 10 mounted on my bicycle handlebar. For this recording, I turned off both the stabilizer and GPS. I used two batteries to record just under two hours of video.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I ride a Trek Marlin 5 Gen 2, which I’ve had for almost two years. I really like it, it just works!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The gym was almost empty today (Nov 30th, 2024), it felt like heaven. I even warmed up on the chest press machine. I took proper rest between sets and completed six exercises. Overall, it was a good workout today. The gym had been closed for two days for the Thanksgiving holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Afterward, I went for some cardio and ran/walked a little over 5K on the treadmill in over 60 minutes. While running, I watched Season 6, Episode 2 (the “black shirt” episode) of &lt;em&gt;Peaky Blinders&lt;/em&gt;. The only reason I resubscribed to Netflix for $6.99 a month was to catch up on this show. Even so, I still have to endure ads with their basic plan. I take out my AirPods during ad breaks. And no, I’m not upgrading to their “better” plan lol.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
