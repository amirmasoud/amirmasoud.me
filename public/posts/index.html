<p>They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but it was too cold for me to sit outside. The indoor environment is beautiful and cozy, and the view of the quiet street on a Saturday was actually quite nice.</p>

<p>I used a GoPro 10 mounted on my bicycle handlebar. For this recording, I turned off both the stabilizer and GPS. I used two batteries to record just under two hours of video.</p>
<p>I ride a Trek Marlin 5 Gen 2, which I’ve had for almost two years. I really like it, it just works!</p>

      <p>The gym was almost empty today (Nov 30th, 2024), it felt like heaven. I even warmed up on the chest press machine. I took proper rest between sets and completed six exercises. Overall, it was a good workout today. The gym had been closed for two days for the Thanksgiving holiday.</p>
<p>Afterward, I went for some cardio and ran/walked a little over 5K on the treadmill in over 60 minutes. While running, I watched Season 6, Episode 2 (the “black shirt” episode) of <em>Peaky Blinders</em>. The only reason I resubscribed to Netflix for $6.99 a month was to catch up on this show. Even so, I still have to endure ads with their basic plan. I take out my AirPods during ad breaks. And no, I’m not upgrading to their “better” plan lol.</p>

      <p>For the first time, I decided to cook a turkey for 2024 Thanksgiving! I’d never done it before, and I wasn’t sure what I needed, but I knew one thing for sure: I needed a turkey!</p>
<p>I went to Costco and chose the smallest turkey they had, which was just over 10 pounds (sorry, little fella). They had turkeys over 20 pounds, but I went with the smaller size because it is just me (lol). The turkey was priced at $0.99 per pound. It was snowing in Salt Lake City when I went on Tuesday, November 26th. I grabbed my turkey, along with a couple of random seasonings, although I ended up not using them.</p>

<p>At that time, the restaurant was fully packed with people dining. There was live music, and the lighting was dim. The server at my table brought me water and handed me the menu. They have a variety of foods and drinks to choose from, and, let’s be honest, they were pricey. Take a look at the menu:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

      <p>The book covers a portion of problems, solutions, mistakes, and some solutions to personal life happenings. It is more on the side of motivational speech rather than giving you a roadmap. Of course, if you are looking for a well-thought solution, this book might not suit your will. It is more of a written YouTube motivational video that showcases quotes from well-known people and tries to hype you up.</p>
<p>It gives solutions like you should give up your bad habits, build good habits instead of it, or you need to change your subconscious without any further details on how one should accomplish such goals. Until the last chapter of the book, where the author introduces his website and claims you need a coach to develop such traits in yourself, which leaves you wondering that you were reading a marketing book all along for his website and advertising his personal development programs.</p>
