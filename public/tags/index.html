      <p>The book covers a portion of problems, solutions, mistakes, and some solutions to personal life happenings. It is more on the side of motivational speech rather than giving you a roadmap. Of course, if you are looking for a well-thought solution, this book might not suit your will. It is more of a written YouTube motivational video that showcases quotes from well-known people and tries to hype you up.</p>
<p>It gives solutions like you should give up your bad habits, build good habits instead of it, or you need to change your subconscious without any further details on how one should accomplish such goals. Until the last chapter of the book, where the author introduces his website and claims you need a coach to develop such traits in yourself, which leaves you wondering that you were reading a marketing book all along for his website and advertising his personal development programs.</p>

      <p>The book is a very fragmented, a shortened version of papers. I have to say the book seems very like a how to be a perfect flattering person in your career. If you really believe you want to spend the rest of your life in a hierarchical organization. You just want to get promotion and earn money, this book can be your hidden gem but comes at the cost of literally giving up yourself to satisfy your boss(es) and colleague; this is far away from having an ego.</p>
